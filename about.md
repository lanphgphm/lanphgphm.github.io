`Into the Namespaces` is the result of my desire to consolidate my thoughts, progress, and overall digital existence into one single place. When writing on social media platforms, I usually feel like I am writing to perform, because the post will be promoted to a list of friends immediately after publishing. The tug between writing for myself and writing for an audience becomes a freuqent dilemma, which distracts from the initial motivation to write in the first place. 

I often found people's blogs very helpful when it comes to learning new concepts. I read multiple blogs explaining the same thing, and benefit from the way each person puts it slightly differently. Another reason why I enjoy blogposts and forum discussions so much are the trivia I get along the journey, like little unexpected sidequests. 

This blog is primarily my learning log, where I write about what I learned, worked, encountered, that might be helpful to somebody one day. I am, in general, a person filled with gratitude, as I constantly enjoy the fruits of the open-sourced software community. This is one in many little attempts of mine in giving back. 

I would also like to give credit to my undergraduate school senior, who is an inspiring figure in general, but specifically whose PhD journal tagline "A node in your knowledge graph" gave me that one last push to make my own blog. 

The name 'Into the Namespaces' is a tribute to one of my favorite features of the Linux kernel: Namespaces and Cgroups, the isolation mechanism that makes containerization technology possible.
